A refresh of Emmet, SVG and Tables

# 1. SVG
“SVG” stands for “Scalable Vector Graphic”. Vector graphics are simply images defined by math, as opposed to traditional “raster graphics,” where your image is defined by a grid of pixels.

With raster graphics, the detail is limited to the size of that pixel grid. If you want to increase the size of the image (scale it), you have to increase the size of that grid. How do you decide what all those new pixels should look like? There’s no simple solution. Additionally, the larger the grid, the bigger your filesize grows.

With vector graphics on the other hand, there’s no grid. Instead, you have formulas for different shapes and lines. Since these are just formulas, it doesn’t matter how large or small you want them to appear–they can scale to any size you want, and it will have no effect on the quality or the size of the file.

SVGs have another interesting aspect to them: they’re defined using XML. XML (aka, “Extensible Markup Language”) is an HTML-like syntax which is used for lots of things, from APIs, to RSS, to spreadsheet and word editor software.

# Benefits of SVG
1. First, it means that it is *human-readable*.
