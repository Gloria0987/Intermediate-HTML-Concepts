# 1. SVG
“SVG” stands for “Scalable Vector Graphic”. Vector graphics are simply images defined by math, as opposed to traditional “raster graphics,” where your image is defined by a grid of pixels.

With raster graphics, the detail is limited to the size of that pixel grid. If you want to increase the size of the image (scale it), you have to increase the size of that grid. How do you decide what all those new pixels should look like? There’s no simple solution. Additionally, the larger the grid, the bigger your filesize grows.
